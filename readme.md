# 2048
A Web3 3D puzzle game built with Unity and integrated with BNB Smart Chain (BSC) via Idos Games SDK. Players merge cubes, strategize moves, and earn on-chain rewards.

Unlike the classic 2D version, here you will play with 3D cubes, which adds an extra layer of challenge and interest. 

The goal is to move cubes in 3D space, merging identical ones to form higher value cubes. A merge is possible only when cubes are next to each other. Each turn the player can move a cube into one of the free positions on the field. If no valid moves remain, the game ends.
